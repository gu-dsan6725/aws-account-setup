## Login Instructions

If you received a new AWS account and need instructions to access your new lab learner, please follow these steps:

1. **AWS Course Invite**:  
   Professor Amit or a TA will send you a new AWS course invite which will grant access to a new learner lab account associated with your Georgetown email and a `+n` (e.g., `johndoe124+1@georgetown.edu`).

2. **Accept the Invite**:  
   Click on the invite link. This should take you to the **AWS Academy login page**.

3. **Log in Using Your Old Account**:  
   **DO NOT use the new email (`+n` email) to log in.** Instead, log in using your ORIGINAL Georgetown email (without the `+n`).

4. **Update Your Contact Email**:  
   - Once inside your old account, navigate to **Account** > **Settings**.  
   - On the upper-right side, find the **"Ways of Contact"** section.  
   - Click on the ‚≠ê star next to your `+n` email to set it as the primary email.

### Note on `+n` Email Notation
The `+n` in your email (e.g., `johndoe124+1@georgetown.edu`) represents the number of AWS accounts you have requested. The first request will have `+1`, the second will have `+2`, and so on. This helps differentiate multiple accounts associated with the same email.
